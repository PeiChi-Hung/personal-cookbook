## Introduction
A project born out of my personal struggle with managing recipe videos scattered across multiple platforms. The frustration of hunting for a specific dish when cravings strike, coupled with the difficulty of deciding what to eat and the tendency to forget recipes over time, led me to create a solution. With Personal Cookbook, you can effortlessly organize your favourite recipes, eliminating the need to sift through various platforms. The added feature of a shuffle button allows for spontaneous recipe inspiration from your collection. No more watching entire videos to recall ingredients â€“ it's all at your fingertips, making your culinary journey simpler and more enjoyable.
